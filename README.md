# Advent-of-Code

I am using the advent of code to learn and deepen my understanding of various languages.
Because of that, my code will not be as clean as it might be.

## 2023 : Fortran

Fortran seemed to be an interesting langage, so i tried to learn it. I mainly focus on
fortran 90.

## 2024 : CUDA

I wish to improve my experience with modern CUDA, even if the advent of code problems
are not really made for GPU.
