# Why ?

At that time, I was an intern at the CEA (Commissariat à l'énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives),
and i heard about Fortran. Furthermore, i was discovering CUDA, and I saw that Fortran was one
of main languages. That led me to try and learn Fortran.

# Afterthought

Fortran is a nice and funny language to use. Unfortunately, in Fortran 90,
there is not much standard library or free existing clean code online, so I needed
to rewrite most of the thing I use. It would be a great idea to write myself a small library
before attempting something like that again.
