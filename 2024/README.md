# Why ?

During my Image specialization at EPITA, I had multiple courses
about CUDA and GPU programming. One of them introduced me to
modern CUDA, with the use of library such as raft, rmm, thrust and CUB.

I wanted to pratice using it through the Advent Of Code even if most of
the AOC problem are not suitable for GPU.
